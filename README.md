# FoundryVTT - Pathfinder-ui v3
A very questionable fork of dodgy fork of RPG Styled Ui by Xbozon restyled by Brendan for Pathfinder 2e.

## Installation

To install, follow these instructions:

1.  Inside Foundry, select the Game Modules tab in the Configuration and Setup menu.
2.  Click the Install Module button and enter the following URL: 
https://gitlab.com/sasmira/pathfinder-ui/-/raw/master/module/module.json (TODO: FIX URL)
3.  Click Install and wait for installation to complete.

## This has been drilled down to only altering the look of: :

1.  __**Combat Carousel**__  ! require [Combat Carousel](https://github.com/death-save/combat-carousel)
